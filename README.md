This is a journal, and you can learn about me through these.

There is about me in college, Second half of the semester.

It has already begun.

## Daily ledger

【:spiral_notepad:】::question:

Daily bookkeeping helps you develop a habit of having enough control over money. Big money is spent on the blade and small money is spent on growth.

## everyday life

[- Diary -]:

It must be a different experience to record the beautiful daily life of the University and recall the past when you graduate from the University.

## Subject learning

【record--review】:

Confucius said, "learning without thinking is a waste, thinking without learning is dangerous". Making daily learning records is a step that cannot be obtained in the later review. Review the knowledge every week to deepen the understanding of the knowledge points.
